What is the significance of the slope in regression analysis, and how does it affect predictions?\n","\n","    - In regression analysis, the slope plays a crucial role in understanding the relationship between variables. It represents the rate of change of the dependent variable concerning the independent variable. If the slope is positive, it means that as the independent variable increases, the dependent variable also increases. Conversely, a negative slope indicates a decrease in the dependent variable when the independent variable rises.\n","\n","      The slope directly affects predictions. A steep slope suggests significant changes in the dependent variable for small variations in the independent variable, while a shallow slope implies minimal impact.

More predictors can artificially inflate R² without improving the model’s true effectiveness.\n","\n","      - A complex model with too many variables may have a high R² but fail when tested on unseen data.\n","\n","      - Extreme values can distort R², making the model appear better or worse than it really is.\n","\n","       - A strong R² doesn’t prove a causal relationship between variables, only correlation."],"metadata":{"id":"aHRW6TW9bcVT"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["19. How would you interpret a large standard error for a regression coefficient?\n","\n","    - A large standard error for a regression coefficient indicates that the estimate of the coefficient is uncertain or highly variable. This could be due to factors such as small sample size, high multicollinearity, or a weak relationship between the independent and dependent variables. It suggests that the coefficient might not be a reliable predictor, and its true value may vary significantly across different samples.

How can heteroscedasticity be identified in residual plots, and why is it important to address it?\n","\n","    - Heteroscedasticity occurs when the variability of residuals changes across different values of the independent variable. In residual plots, it appears as a fan-shaped or cone-shaped pattern, where errors become larger as the predicted values increase. This violates a key assumption of regression, where residuals should have constant variance.\n","\n","      Addressing heteroscedasticity is crucial because it can lead to biased standard errors, making hypothesis tests and confidence intervals unreliable.

Why is it important to scale variables in Multiple Linear Regression?\n","\n","    - Scaling variables in Multiple Linear Regression is important to ensure that all predictors contribute equally to the model, especially when they have different units or ranges.
